# ClockInOut
Just a desktop app that uses Google Sheets API to log clock in and out times of employees. This app is a product of necessity at my workplace (Wireless Warehouse). Please add your client_secret.json file to the root of the project. This is the file with API key of the service account for accessing the Google sheets.
